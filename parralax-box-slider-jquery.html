should resort to random sampling so that bias can be eliminated and sampling error can be estimated.
But purposive sampling is considered desirable when the universe happens to be small and a known
characteristic of it is to be studied intensively. Also, there are conditions under which sample designs
other than random sampling may be considered better for reasons like convenience and low costs.
The sample design to be used must be decided by the researcher taking into consideration the
nature of the inquiry and other related factors.
6. Collecting the data: In dealing with any real life problem it is often found that data at hand are
inadequate, and hence, it becomes necessary to collect data that are appropriate. There are several
ways of collecting the appropriate data which differ considerably in context of money costs, time and
other resources at the disposal of the researcher.
Primary data can be collected either through experiment or through survey. If the researcher
conducts an experiment, he observes some quantitative measurements, or the data, with the help of
which he examines the truth contained in his hypothesis. But in the case of a survey, data can be
collected by any one or more of the following ways:
(i) By observation: This method implies the collection

Quite frequently these days people talk of research, both in academic institutions and outside. Several
research studies are undertaken and accomplished year after year. But in most cases very little
attention is paid to an important dimension relaing to research, namely, that of research methodology.
The result is that much of research, particularly in social sciences, contains endless word-spinning
and too many quotations. Thus a great deal of research tends to be futile. It may be noted, in the
context of planning and development, that the significance of research lies in its quality and not in
quantity. The need, therefore, is for those concerned with research to pay due attention to designing
and adhering to the appropriate methodology throughout for improving the quality of research. The
methodology may differ from problem to problem, yet the basic approach towards research remains
the same.</p>
